# xrpmints-mvp
This is a prototype of the dApp we are currently working on. 
This MVP(Minimally Viable Product) showcases many of the features we incorporate into the site, at launch incorporated features may vary depending on your feedback. 
The dApp UI/UX at launch may/will look quite different as this prototype UI/UX allows for easy navigation of our feautures
and was intended to allow users to get an idea of how these features would work and how we can improve them based on your feedback.
We highly encourage you to provide us with you're feedback, and appreciate all the feedback we can get. 
if you're interested in collaborating and working on this project along side us shoot me a message on "X" @xrpmints. 
Thank you XRP Army! <3.
